/*----- Installation ------*/

    1. Some files/folders are hidden; Ctrl + H to unhide them.


    2. Install curl.  (sudo apt-get install curl)
    
    
    3. Move the ".harmattan-assets" folder into your home folder.
    
    
    4. Each theme is a single text-file called .conkyrc. These files are inside the ".harmattan-themes" folder. They are separated across many folders for easier navigation.
    
    
    5. Move your chosen .conkyrc file and put it into your home folder.
    
    
    6. Open the terminal and type "conky" to start your conky.
    
    
    7. In order to display the weather of your city, open your .conkyrc file and find the number "44418". This number is the WOEID(Where On Earth ID).
In order to find the WOEID of your city, go to the Yahoo weather page and search for your city. You will find the WOEID of your city in the URL bar of your browser!
 



/*------ Moving the conky around ------*/

    
  - In order to move the conky around, all you have to do is manipulate the numbers "gap_x" and "gap_y" in you ".conkyrc" file.
    
  - You can also position the conky using the "alignment" configuration. Find the line "#alignment middle_middle".
First uncomment the line(remove the "#" symbol), then manipulate the value. Available options are middle_middle, top_left, bottom_right, etc.
    
  - Keep in mind that "gap_x" and "gap_y" still work after you activate "alignment", so either comment them out(add "#") or use them in combination with "alignment".
