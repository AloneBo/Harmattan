/*------ Tips n tricks ------*/
 
Here are two useful tricks to keep the clode cleaner:
        
 - Backlash -->  \
    Used to join lines together. It allows to separate text across multiple lines without pushing the conky down. This is especially useful for adding many image links.

 - Hash -->  #
    Useful for adding inline comments. Make sure you donÂ´t use a hash and a backlash on the same line!
 


/*------ Structure ------*/

  All assets are inside the ".harmattan-assets" folder and are separated into photos, icons, and misc.
    
  - "icons" contains all the big and small weather icons except for humidity, pressure, wind, sunrise/sunset. Folders are separated by size and color of icons.


  - "photos" contains all the weather photos. Folders are separated by size and the corner radius.


  - "misc" contains all other assets (backgrounds. separators, etc) as well as the icons for humidity, pressure, wind, sunrise/sunset. Folders are separated by theme names.
